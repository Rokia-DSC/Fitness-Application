## Fitness App (Flutter)

### Overview
This Flutter app is designed to help users track their fitness journey, providing exercise details, BMI calculation, and targeted workouts for specific body parts.

### Features
1. *Exercise List Screen:*
   - Displays a list of all available exercises.
   - Users can tap on an exercise to view its details.

2. *Exercise Details Screen:*
   - Shows detailed information about a selected exercise (e.g., description, muscle groups targeted, difficulty level).

3. *BMI Calculator:*
   - Calculates the user's Body Mass Index (BMI) based on their weight and height.
   - Provides a classification (underweight, normal weight, overweight, etc.).

4. *Body Focus Workouts:*
   - Offers targeted workouts for specific body parts (e.g., back, arms, chest, legs).
   - Users can choose a focus area and access relevant exercises.

### Architecture (MVVM)
The app follows the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architectural pattern:

- *Model:* Represents the data (exercises, etc.).
- *View:* Handles UI components (screens, widgets).
- *ViewModel:* Manages the business logic and communicates between the Model and View.
